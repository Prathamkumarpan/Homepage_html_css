        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Would you like me to give you a formula for success? It's quite simple, really: Double your rate of failure.
            You are thinking of failure as the enemy of success. But it isn't at all. You can be discouraged by failure
            or you can learn from it, so go ahead and make mistakes. Make all you can. Because remember that's where you
            will find success.<br><br>
            SUCCESS is the only magazine that focuses on people who take full responsibility for their own development
            and income. SUCCESS readers understand that the world has changed and the classic employer-to-employee
            relationship has changed from a patriarchal to a transactional one. No longer can you expect a corporate
            training program and a predictable growth track. Our readers understand and embrace that they are
            responsible for their own long-term success and happiness, and need to be proactive in finding the
            inspiration, motivation and training to achieve their goals. Some may choose to start their own business but
            will prefer to keep it small—what some would call a micro business—so they will always have total control
            and visibility over its growth, spirit and contributions to society. SUCCESS readers desire the freedom and
            control to make all meaningful business decisions.

                faliure Success is the state or condition of meeting a defined range of expectations. It may be viewed
                as the opposite of failure. The criteria for success depend on context, and may be relative to a
                particular observer or belief system.
